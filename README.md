# gb-save-dumper-n64
A simple tool to dump your GameBoy save game file using your N64, TransferPak and everdrive64!

## Installation 

This application was build for the X-Series of the everdrive64 in mind! Just use this save dumper if you're on v3.04 and above!
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/ner01/gb-save-dumper-n64/releases/tag/latest) and download the v64 file. Put it anywhere on your sd card and start the application like a game on your everdrive64. The application will save the file to the root of your SD card.

## Build

First setup an n64 developer enviroment. I suggest [this](https://werkn.github.io/en/posts/n64-homebrew-setup/) guide to get the setup right. Simply run make to build this application
